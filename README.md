# Description:

rMETAshell is a command-line tool for injecting a reverse shell command into the metadata and generating one-liner execution methods.

# How It Works:
rMETAshell takes a reverse shell command and an image, video or text file as input. It then injects the command into the file using metadata comments. After injection, it generates a one-liner execution method for retrieving and executing the injected command from a remote location.

# Features:
Metadata-Based Shell Injection: Inject reverse shell commands into image, video, and text file metadata, ensuring seamless integration with target systems.

One-Liner Generation: Automatically generate one-liners for quick and efficient remote shell access. Choose from a variety of execution methods tailored to different file formats.

Supported File Formats: rMETAshell supports the following file formats for shell injection and one-liner generation:

Image Formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, and more.
Video Formats: MP4, AVI, MKV, and others.
Text Formats: TXT, CSV, XML, and more.

# Requirements:
Linux-based operating system (Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
Dependencies: ExifTool, Exiv2, ImageMagick (identify), FFprobe, Curl, Sed
Compatible file formats: Media (e.g., images, videos), Text files (e.g., HTML, XML)
Zip and Rar archive support

# Installation:

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/git5loxosec/rMETAshell.git
```

Navigate to the rMETAshell directory:
```
cd rMETAshell
```

Run the script with the desired options:
```
./rMETAshell [OPTIONS] <REVERSE_SHELL_COMMAND> <filename> <URL>
Replace [OPTIONS], <REVERSE_SHELL_COMMAND>, <filename>, and <URL> with the appropriate values. For more details, use the -h or --help option.

```

Follow the prompts to select an execution method based on the file format.
